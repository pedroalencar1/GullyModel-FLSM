# GullyModel_FLSM
code of the model FL-SM

This program was developed by Pedro Alencar as part of his PhD project "Advances in hydrosedimentological modelling using the principal of maximum entropy" as a first approach for gully erosion modelling.

The model inputs are divided in to files:
  1. Hillslope data
  2. Discharge data
  
Hillslope data can be obtained from literature as well as from local and/or laboratory measurements.
Discharge data can be measured os modelled. In the file attached the discharge data was obtained from rainfall intensity curves and converted to discharge using the SCS-CN model.

The model output is a single file presenting the two stages of the gully growing (before and after reaching the non-erodible layer); The values for width and depth for each event are listed. The values for the final reached stage are listed, including top width and wall slope if existing.
